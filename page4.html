            <p>Post- Placement Process<br>

                • Employment Formalities
                Selected students shall go through all employment formalities, as outlined by the company. This could include medical tests, visits to the company and other prescribed formalities.
                <br>
                • Offer Letters
                Students shall coordinate with the Placement Department for their offer letters sent by the companies. It is common for companies to send the offer letters to the Institute, several months after placements. Students must be patient and be in touch with the Placement Team for the same.
                - Any discrepancy in the offer letter needs to be resolved directly between the student and the company, since several matters are discussed directly between the student and the company, during the interview process, which the Placement Team could be unaware of.
                - Only in severe cases of discrepancy, should the Placement Team be requested to intervene.</p>

        <a href="#" onclick="toggleInfo('info5')">Other Guidelines</a>
        <div id="info5" class="info">
            <p>Sure, here's a summary:<br>

                1. Code of Conduct: Students must act professionally, communicate through the Placement Cell, avoid unsolicited language, and adhere to company guidelines. The Placement Cell may take action if guidelines are violated.<br>
                
                2. Dress Code: Business formals are mandatory for all interactions with companies, including online or offline sessions.<br>
                
                3. Timelines for Joining: Students join companies only after completing their course in May/June of the subsequent year. Early joining may be allowed in some cases.<br>
                
                4. Onboarding Complexity: Empaneled company-placed students wait three quarters starting from June every year before onboarding. They can apply for other placements if not onboarded in the first quarter.<br>
                
                5. Withdrawal Notice: Students not interested in placement must inform the Placement Cell at the beginning of the academic year through a signed letter in the prescribed format.</p>

        <a href="#" onclick="toggleInfo('info6')">Best Pratices for Students</a>
        <div id="info6" class="info">
            <p>1. Strategy and Organization:Develop a plan early on, form a Placement Forum, and appoint a Secretary to coordinate efforts. Have a single point of contact for the Career Management Center (CMC) to ensure an organized approach.<br>

                2. Communication with Placement Committee: Use the class Placement Committee as a liaison between students and the Placement Cell. Direct general queries, applications, and follow-ups through them.<br>
                
                3. Stay Informed:Check the Placement notice board and official social platforms daily, especially during placement season, to avoid missing important notices and updates.<br>
                
                4. Prompt Follow-up:Follow up promptly with the Placement Cell based on company feedback to maintain candidacy and not lose opportunities to other students.<br>
                
                5. Leverage Alumni Networks:Stay connected with alumni working in desired companies throughout the year, not just during placement season. Alumni can provide valuable insights and connections.<br>
                
                6. Maximize Internship Opportunities: Summer and other internships offer great chances to make an impact and secure Pre-Placement Offers. Make the most of these experiences to enhance your career prospects.<br>
                
                7. Engage in Multiple Events:Interact with companies at various events such as case competitions, guest lectures, industry visits, and club activities to broaden your network and exposure to potential employers.</p>
